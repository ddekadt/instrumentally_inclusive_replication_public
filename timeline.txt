# Initial Events:

Sept '24: I wrote my report

2 Oct '24: I sent it to the original authors as a courtesy, and told them I would send it to the APSR team on the 23rd as a courtesy, before posting on my website on 1 Nov.

10 Oct '24: The original authors replied. 

23 Oct '24: I determined that their email did not change my perspective on the original paper or my replication, and sent the report to both the APSR editorial team and CUP's publishing ethics team in an email (as I had indicated I would).

# Formal Review Process:

1 Nov '24: The APSR team invited me to submit on the reappraisals/replication track. For personal reasons I decided not to post publicly on 1 Nov. [Note: I was unaware of the existence of this new publication track at the APSR until I received this invitation.]

10 Jan '25: I received an invitation to revise and resubmit the paper after external review. 

2 June '25: I submitted a revised version of the paper.

# Post-Acceptance Process:

9 July '25: I received a conditional accept subject to some internal APSR steps that required I submit initial replication materials for review [I do not know the details of this process.]

July '25: The original authors wrote to the APSR to suggest a corrigendum, and were informed that the replication was forthcoming [here I rely on the original authors' account of the process and have no further details.]

26 September '25: The paper was officially conditionally accepted in editorial manager, and replication materials were formally submitted to dataverse. 

28 November '25: The paper was released on FirstView.
