Subject: Reproduction of "Instrumentally Inclusive"

Dear Prof. [redacted] and Prof. [redacted]

I'm writing to share with you a comment on your recent paper in the APSR, "Instrumentally Inclusive: The Political Psychology of Homonationalism."

The comment is attached, and as you will see it raises some concerns with the empirical elements of the paper. 

By way of background, I teach a causal inference class at LSE in which students are asked to replicate, critique, and extend recent empirical papers in leading social science journals. Your paper was one I was considering assigning this academic year. On downloading the archive and beginning the replication process myself I noticed some of the issues highlighted in the comment. 

I plan to post the comment on my public website on November 1. Before then, on October 23, I will share the comment with the APSR editorial team so that they are aware ahead of time. I am sharing this with you now as a professional courtesy.

Sincerely,

Daniel de Kadt
