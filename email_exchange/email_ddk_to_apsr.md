Subject: Concerns Regarding "Instrumentally Inclusive: The Political Psychology of Homonationalism" (vol. 118, issue 3)

Dear Editors of the American Political Science Review,

I am writing to bring to your attention the attached comment that I have drafted about a recently published paper in your journal titled "Instrumentally Inclusive: The Political Psychology of Homonationalism" (vol. 118, issue 3) by Turnbull-Dugarte and López Ortega. The report is also available in a (currently private) github repository which I am happy to provide access to if needed. 

The published paper presents results from two similar experiments. In the comment I raise two major concerns about the results of the second experiment as presented in the published paper:

The published results of the second experiment (Spain) rely on unusual survey weights, the results largely disappear when these weights are not used, and neither the origin nor the reason for using weights is ever explained. This sensitivity appears to derive from the weights' distribution, with roughly two-thirds of the respondents receiving weights less than 0.1, and roughly one-third receiving a weight of approximately 3. The choice to weight the second experiment is inconsistent with the analysis of the first experiment (UK), where no such weights are used. This choice is never explained or justified in the paper or supplementary materials, and the manner in which the weights were created is not documented with any detail in the paper, supplementary materials, or replication code. 

Throughout the paper the authors selectively report either classical or heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, choices which meaningfully changes the statistical significance of key results in the second experiment. These choices are not documented or explained in the paper or supplementary materials and are inconsistent with best practices. 
I also document a number of more minor inconsistencies between the reporting in the paper and the visualisation of the results:

Figures 3 and 6 in the paper present results from a logistic regression when the text states that ordinary least squares was used. This issue also affects Figure 8 in the published paper. These discrepancies are not discussed in the paper or supplementary materials. 

Figures 4 and 7 in the paper present data points that readers would reasonably expect to be the underlying data in the study, but they are instead jittered predicted values from a regression (a total of two unique data points per plot, with added random noise). These visualisations are misleading to readers without further explanation which is not provided in the paper or supplementary materials.

Across the paper, 90% confidence intervals are presented in the visualisations, but this is never documented or explained in the paper or supplementary materials, and readers would understandably expect a different default. 
In the conclusion of the comment I further enumerate a number of small errors in the published manuscript.

My perspective on this matter is that these concerns are significant and require remedy, in line with the APSR's [statement on publishing ethics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/information/journal-policies/publishing-ethics) and the [COPE guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines). I appreciate that the Editors and the authors of the paper may have a different perspective. 

My current intention is to release this comment publicly in one week's time (on 1 November 2024). However, if the Editors would prefer that I take a different approach (e.g. follow an in-house process) please do let me know. 

Finally, I would like to note that I provided a (very similar) copy of this comment to the authors three weeks ago, and they acknowledged receipt. I am happy to share that email exchange if requested. 

Sincerely,

Daniel de Kadt
