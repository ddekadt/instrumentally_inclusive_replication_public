# Archive for "A Note on Turnbull-Dugarte & López Ortega (2024)"

This repo includes all markdown, code, and supporting files to reproduce "A Note on 'Instrumentally Inclusive: The Political Psychology
of Homonationalism' (Turnbull-Dugarte & López Ortega, 2024)," published at the _American Political Science Review_. This report highlights two major concerns, and a range of more minor concerns/issues, with that paper.

The repo also includes a few other things: 

- "clean_replication": a copy of the original replication archive which was used to complete a computational reproduction of the paper (largely without issue, minor comments in Appendix 1 of the report), and which provides the data files used in the report. Note that one large file (ESS-Data-Wizard-subset-2023-02-08.dta) is excluded due to GitHub limits on large files.

- "email_exchange": a copy of an email exchange that occurred in October 2024, when the original version of the comment was sent to the authors.

- "apsr_submission" and "apsr_submission_r1": anonymized versions of the comment as submitted to the APSR. 

- "apsr_final" contains the final .tex files and tables and figures (plus supplementary materials .pdf) sent to the APSR for production.

- "apsr_replication_archives" contains the files submitted to the APSR dataverse for replication.
